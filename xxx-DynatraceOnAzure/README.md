# What The Hack - Dynatrace On Azure

## Introduction

This WhatTheHack challenges you to leverage the combined strengths of Dynatrace's all-in-one monitoring platform and the vast capabilities of Microsoft Azure to solve a real-world problem. Dive into application performance monitoring (APM), digital experience monitoring (DEM), infrastructure monitoring, and more, to showcase your skills and unearth hidden insights across your Azure cloud environment.

Here's what you can expect:

* **Full-Stack Monitoring on Azure:** Achieve end-to-end observability for your Azure infrastructure, applications, and services, including Azure VMs, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure App Services, and more.
* **AI-Powered Insights:** Leverage Dynatrace’s AI engine, Davis, to automatically detect anomalies, pinpoint root causes, and provide predictive analytics specifically tailored for Azure environments.
* **Automated Operations:** Streamline your DevOps practices on Azure with automated deployment, continuous delivery, and auto-remediation workflows using Azure DevOps and other Azure services.
* **Real-Time Analytics:** Utilize real-time data to make informed decisions and optimize performance on Azure, ensuring seamless user experiences across your cloud-native and hybrid applications.
* **Enhanced Security:** Integrate security monitoring to detect vulnerabilities within your Azure workloads and mitigate risks proactively.

This hack was designed specifically for Cloud Ops Engineers, DevOps engineers, Developers, and Architects who want to expand their knowledge on Dynatrace & Azure.  However, anyone with passion around Observability is welcome!
