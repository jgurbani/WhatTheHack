# What The Hack - Dynatrace On Azure

## Introduction

This WhatTheHack provide you hands on experience on how to Monitor Azure workloads using Dynatrace.   It will show you how Dynatrace's AI-engine, Davis, performs automatic and intelligent root-cause analysis in hybrid cloud Azure environments. This hack was designed specifically for Cloud Ops Engineers, DevOps engineers, Developers, and Architects who want to expand their knowledge on Dynatrace & Azure.  However, anyone with passion around Observability is welcome!


## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will be solving business problems that companies in the Retail industry face by replacing their legacy systems.  The new systems will be able to:

- Setup a Dynatrace environment and sample applications within Azure
- Jump in and fully analyze an application within Dynatrace
- Start to see and understand application usage patterns, infrastructure consumption, service dependencies, benchmarking performance and how service levels can be tightly ensured.


## Challenges

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Prepare your environment to work with Azure and Dynatrace.
- Challenge 01: **[OneAgent Observability on Azure VM](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - Review the power on OneAgent.
- Challenge 02: **[Dynatrace Observability on AKS](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
